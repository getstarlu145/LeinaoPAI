### Basic image 
#### gunpower
A library to facilitate machine learning on multi-dimensional images.

"gunpowder" allows you to assemble a pipeline from data loading over pre-processing, random batch sampling, data augmentation, 
pre-caching, training/prediction, to storage of results on arbitrarily large volumes of multi-dimensional images. 
gunpowder is not tied to a particular learning framework, and thus complements libraries like tensorflow or caffe.

Refer to https://github.com/funkey/gunpowder http://funkey.science/gunpowder/ for details.

It is proposed in paper--A Deep Structured Learning Approach Towards Automating Connectome Reconstruction from 3D Electron Micrographs.
